Introduction: 
Project one provides data for SAT for the years 2017 and 2018 for all states in the USA plus the District of Columbia. This data includes participation rate and test scores. In this project we analyze the data and come up with recommendations for the College Board on how to increase the participation rate of students in States where the participation rate is low. The data file is in .csv format. A PDF of the presentation is also included.

Problem Statement:
Some states have a low participation rate in SAT exams. The college board would like to know how to increase the participation rate of these states. 

Executive Summary:
We looked at participation rates of students in the SAT for the years 2017 and 2018 for all the states plus the District of Columbia. Some states improved significantly and we recommend learning from what those states did to increase the participation rate of their students in the SAT and ACT exams.
